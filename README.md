# Javascript Password Generator
This repo is for the 2nd challenge project for bootcamp to demonstrate my understanding of javascript.

# Purpose of this challenge
I understood the purpose of this challenge as being able to demonstrate basic JAVASCRIPT code with a password generator website that is dependant on the users interaction with the website. The most challenging aspect of this challenge was where to start. Initially I understood the concepts of this challenge but not how to apply them. 
After my first tutor session for this challenge, my understanding of Javascript has improved.

Something significant I learned about Javascript is the importance of unique and descriptive function names.
